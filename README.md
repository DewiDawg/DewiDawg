- 👋 Hi, I’m @DewiDawg
- 👀 I’m recently retired. Did quite a bit of coding back in the 80's & 90's, so am getting iinto Python, micropython & arduino stuff to keep my brain working.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning arduino with ESP8266/ESP32 and Pi Pico with micrpython, and have also got hold of 2 Raspberry Pi's to play with!
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn & share any learning
